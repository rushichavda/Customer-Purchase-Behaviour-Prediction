Millennials have become a major part of our customer base now and as the internet reach is widening into all generations, every person with a mobile is a potential customer for e-commerce sites. This shift makes predicting customer  behavior all the more pertinent and gives you an edge in the competition. 

Once we help you predict customer behavior and customize their shopping process it will help boost sales, increase customer satisfaction and will certainly result in higher conversion rates and competitive  advantage.

## Approach and Outcomes :

1) We took a “customer_shoppers_intentions.csv” and extracted independent features which affect the Odds of customer Purchase.
2) We Did Descriptive Data Analysis on the data set to understand the data and trends into the data.
3) Data Processing was done to convert data from categorical to numerical keeping in mind ordinal, nominal  data types.
4) The dataset is divided into 80:20 train-test ratio and these  algorithms are compared based  on their accuracy on the test  dataset.
5) Classification and Clustering was used since outcome is binary.
6) We Used Different Classifier to know which one is working best in aforementioned  conditions.We Used all the Theories (Models) Taught In Class relevant to classification task.
7) from our method we found that Neural Network Classifier is working best in our case
